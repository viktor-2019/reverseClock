# reverseClock
it's a simplest clock which show time to some time.
First step is to set the time which you wait. This version has no interface, but you may set it as
a parametr of function start() in the file app.js
The format of patametr is array with numbers of Date:  [year, month, day, hours,minutes,seconds]

I'll add some buttons when it necessary.
